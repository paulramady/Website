<p><h3> PROBLEMS ARCHIVE 2</h3> </p> 

<p><h4> 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
        E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h4></p>
       
<p>
        I found that Trello was useful for helping me manage most aspects of the project management and it was easy to update it with new tasks as they were handed to us. 
        Visual studio I found to be ok, it's a powerful tool for coding but I found it cumbersome in some areas, particularly in the linkage between HTML and CSS. I think 
        some coding software that allows you to see the results of your code in real time would be more beneficial. VS could also be more user friendly in providing tutorials to
        help learm the languages.

       </P>
<p>
        <h4>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h4>

        I think I've covered this in what I wrote above. Both are powerful tools but i feel that VS could do with several improvements. 
</p>
 <p>  <h4>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the
        website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?  </h4>
        
        In one word, no I'm not particulary happy with my website. I am a bit of a perfectionist and like to ensure that I am fully satisfied with the end product.
        Time limitation and lack of coding knowledge were significant downfalls in the end product. There is so much more I would have loved to do with it and I will
        continue to work on it after the course until I feel it is complete. I am happy with the overall structure and design of the site but I feel it is let down by
        the asthetic qualities of the page links such as the navigation bar, buttons, links and even text fonts and colour. I would have liked to spend much more time on
        these elements. The code itself is also a bit messy and I would have liked to have tidied this up and got to know CSS a lot better! 
</p>      
<p>   <h4>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h4>

        So first of all I would like to tidy up my code and learn HTML and CSS a lot more! This wouuld enable me to materialise the creative vision I have for the site.
        If I was to publish this online then I would also like to give it some SEO (metatags etc). I think it could do with an overhall in navigation around the site too to optimise the user experience.
        I haven't had a chance to test it on a mobile platform or any other browsers apary from Chrome, so this again is something I will be doing and carrying out necessary changes as required.
