<p class="main"> Welcome to the Unicorn Matrix, I am Paul "the Architect"! In the real world I am also a proud dad of a unicorn princess!
<br></br>
    I am also a Chemistry graduate who has worked in a range of positions  such as: a Laboratory Manager, Technical Manager, Recruitment Consultant (IT and Scientific) and Company Director! I have an extensive range of skills from Project Management (Â£1m+ budgets), Staff management, technical troubleshooting and problem solving, QA / QC, Database creation and management right through to Business Development and Sales! 


<br></br>
The reason I came to Code Nation was to learn a new skill set in coding. Having recruited for developers in SQL, C#, MS Dynamics etc, I thought it about time I developed my understanding further, and as I have thorouhly enjoyed my experience I hope one day to become a technical consulant, implementation consultant, developer or project manager! </br>
