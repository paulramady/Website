<p><h3> PROBLEMS ARCHIVE 3</h3> </p> 

<p><h4>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?  </h4></p>
       
<p>I’m going to start with the main tool used for development - Visual Code Studio. I found this to be a very powerful coding tool with the option to code in several languages. For this project HTLM, CSS and Javascript were used. The integration of these different languages was fairly seamless. I think one of the major drawbacks of this software is the inability to see the results in realtime, so having to refresh save the file and refresh the web browser was cumbersome. On the plus side, the software autocorrects various syntax and shows command options when typing. It doesn’t however correct bugs in the code and this would have been a nice option.
<br></br>
Trello I found to be a good piece of software for Project Management. I’ve already covered a lot of the benefits and drawbacks of using it but in short I found it to be very effective to ensure the project was completed on time. Possibly another drawback apart from those already mentioned is not having the ability to integrate it into calendars to set deadlines and goal posts for completion of tasks. Otherwise I was satisfied how it performed and how it helped me visualise my project to be able to complete it productively and efficiently.
<br></br>
Github was a very good way of backing up and keeping an eye on file versions. This has helped me with productivity by allowing me to work from home when required. The only drawback to this is having to use manual git push and pull commands in the console or terminal. Although I used to be a DOS user it took a while for me to remember the commands and apple IOS has different commands to Windows.
<br></br>
I think a mention on using an Apple Mac and a second screen monitor is in order here too. I found them to be powerful tools used in combination with the ability to project different software onto the native and external display. This is particularly handy in coding and I often ran Visual Studio on one screen and the web browser, Chrome, on the other. The only drawback and it’s a fairly pertinent one is the gesture control system and shortcuts to navigate through the apps. I have always been a Windows user and I found myself often making mistakes or being unaware of gesture controls and commands. I would even go as far to say that this heavily impacted on my productivity and efficiency.
<br></br>
I think this project could have worked well in a team environment as long as a project manager was appointed to delegate tasks to individual team members. One person could have been responsible for the look and feel of the website, another for the content, someone else for coding HTML and the CSS (and Java), and finally another team member  for testing the website, enabling accessibility tools and possibly doing SEO as required.

</p>

<h4>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h4>

<p>I think ultimately for me this comes down to training and understanding of the whole coding process. With a lack of coding skills and language knowledge a way forward for myself is to become familiar with as much language jargon and coding methods as possible. I have researched several methods of coding to solve some of the more complex problems I faced when designing the website. I am glad to report that the majority of what I learned has stuck so I now have new and better ways of implementing code more efficiently which in turn would mean that I should be more productive in future projects! Thank you code nation for the initial knowledge and skills to propel me to where I am now!
</p>

<h4>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do diferently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h4>

<p>I’m going to research and try different coding software platforms to see which best suits me. However fundamentally I’m going to research and learn several languages so that I can use these effectively to solve problems and create projects. This will include front end and back end languages such as JavaScript, HTML, PHP, CSS, C++, C# and SQL. The more options I have the better at this stage. I would also like to research and implement accessibility modules into my future projects and learn about SEO if producing a website.
<br></br>
 Team work would certainly be a massive bonus if this option is available and being a natural leader I believe I could manage projects effectively whilst inputting technical skills as required. 
 <br></br>          
 I would also like to research more project management solutions so will give these a demo when I can in moving forward.
</p>               
                
<h4>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h4>
                
<p>So the first test phase would be for me to test the solution for myself and see where there are fundamental bugs or glitches in the software or website. In the case of a website, this would include testing out links, hyperlinks, functionality and readability on several browsers. If I was to develop a software solution then I would test the product on various platforms and operating system versions. It would be imperative for me to examine the code here particularly looking for missing code, code errors such as incorrect syntax etc. I would examine the functionality in great depth to ensure the solution is serving its purpose. 
<br></br>               
Once this is complete, I would then look further into the code to look for minor issues such as redundant code, spelling mistakes, missing code, spacing and positioning, copyright infractions, and any other minor bugs that would need correcting before launching the product.
<br></br>               
In the final examination,  I would be testing add on modules such as accessibility, speed of the software or website, metatags and SEO if designing a website. Really this stage would be to iron out any final issues and tweaking where required. 
<br></br>               
I would then send the software or website to an external tester or testers for their input too to provide an alternative viewpoint. I believe this is a critical stage. It would also be beneficial to provide users with a feedback form and bug reporting so future updates can be made if necessary.
