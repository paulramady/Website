<p><h3> PROBLEMS ARCHIVE 3</h3> </p> 

<p><h4>Describe the purpose of IT in modern business </h4></p>
       
<p>Most businesses these days are heavily reliant on IT systems whether it be internal or outsourced solutions. Here are some examples of IT in businesses:
<ul>
            <li>ERP / CRM systems </li>
           <li> Websites and SEO </li>
           <li>  Social Media</li>
           <li>  Communications</li>
           <li>  Sales and Marketing</li>
           <li>  Security - Firewall and Antivirus / Anti-malware</li>
           <li>  Manufacturing / Retail</li>
           <li>   Financials</li>
           <li>  Human Resource</li>
           <li>  Purchasing and Inventory</li>
           <li>  Supply Chain management </li>
</ul>
            
            The IT industry is not only needed to create these systems, but maintain, upgrade and replace these as time goes on!

        <h4>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h4>

        Project management system ie Trello, good coding software - compiler or interpreter, coding language ie JavaScript, HTML, C++ etc, testing and quality control, post release support ie patching etc, developers, support team, project manager, any other staff required. Good training, communication and planning are also essential. 
</p>
 <p>  <h4>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your troll board
        Project management using Trello </h4>
        
        Trello board link:
        https://trello.com/b/46R9auvQ/website-design
        
        Using the Moodle coursework slides, I have transferred these instructions over to Trello. Here I have broken down the tasks into smaller chunks to plan out the project. I have organised the tasks into several different areas and implemented a traffic light system to monitor the project, red being the task has not yet been started, amber for the work is underway, and green when completed. 
</p>      
<p>   <h4> 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h4>

        There are many reasons projects fail. These include; being too ambitious, not enough time allocated to projects,  not enough resource, non complimentary personalities of development team, poor / buggy code, not enough expenditure, poor communication internally and with external partners and clients, poor management. 

 <p>   <h4> Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h4>

        This is a very important stage of project planning. Some of the considerations include using optimal languages for front end and back end, using good interpreter / compiler software,  having correct server setup - hosted or local, having right kind of security - hardware firewalls, software - firewall and antivirus. 
</p>
<p>    <h4>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control? </h4>

        Trello has been fundamental to my project planning and monitoring where I need to allocate further resource to complete certain tasks. It is particularly useful in helping me manage my time effectively.       
        Git and Git hub are logical and useful tools for ensuring the latest version of my files are uploaded and backed-up on their servers. Previous file versions are overridden to avoid confusion with multiple version types. These files are also accessible externally should I have the requirement to work from home. 
</p>
 <p>    <h4>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h4>

        The effects of GDPR are quite extensive. In short, Companies that collect data on citizens in European Union (EU) countriesl need to comply with strict new rules around protecting customer data.
        
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets a new standard for consumer rights regarding their data, but companies will be challenged as they put systems and processes in place to maintain compliance.
        
        Compliance will cause some concerns and new expectations of security teams. For example, the GDPR takes a wide view of what constitutes personal identification information. Companies will need the same level of protection for things like an individual’s IP address or cookie data as they do for name, address and Social Security number.
